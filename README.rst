Event Sink ClickHouse
#####################

Purpose
*******

This project acts as a plugin to the `Edx Platform`_, listens for
configured `Open edX events`_, and sends them to a `ClickHouse`_ database for
analytics or other processing. This is being maintained as part of the
`Aspects`_ project.

OARS consumes the data sent to ClickHouse by this plugin as part of data
enrichment for reporting, or capturing data that otherwise does not fit in
xAPI.

Sinks
*****

Currently the only sink is in the CMS. It listens for the ``COURSE_PUBLISHED``
signal and serializes a subset of the published course blocks into one table
in ClickHouse.

Commands
********

In addition to being an event listener, this package provides commands for
exporting the same data in bulk. This allows bootstrapping a new data platform
or backfilling lost or missing data. Currently the only command is the Django
command for the ``COURSE_PUBLISHED`` data:

``python manage.py cms dump_courses_to_clickhouse``

This command allows bulk export of all courses, or various limiting factors.
Please see the command help for details:

``python manage.py cms dump_courses_to_clickhouse -h``

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/openedx-event-sink-clickhouse.git
  cd openedx-event-sink-clickhouse

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 openedx-event-sink-clickhouse


Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  workon openedx-event-sink-clickhouse

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim ...

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit ...
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Deploying
=========

The Open edX Event Sink Clickhouse component is a django plugin which doesn't
need independent deployment. Therefore, its setup is reasonably
straightforward. First, it needs to be added to your service
requirements, and then it will be installed alongside requirements
of the service.

This plugin will be deployed by default in an OARS Tutor environment. For other
deployments install the library or add it to private requirements of your
virtual environment ( ``requirements/private.txt`` ).

#. Run ``pip install openedx-event-sink-clickhouse``.

#. Run migrations:

- ``python manage.py lms migrate``

- ``python manage.py cms migrate``

#. Restart LMS service and celery workers of edx-platform.

Configuration
===============

Currently all events will be listened to by default (there is only one). So
the only necessary configuration is a ClickHouse connection:

.. code-block::

    EVENT_SINK_CLICKHOUSE_BACKEND_CONFIG = {
        # URL to a running ClickHouse server's HTTP interface. ex: https://foo.openedx.org:8443/ or
        # http://foo.openedx.org:8123/ . Note that we only support the ClickHouse HTTP interface
        # to avoid pulling in more dependencies to the platform than necessary.
        "url": "http://clickhouse:8123",
        "username": "changeme",
        "password": "changeme",
        "database": "event_sink",
        "timeout_secs": 3,
    }
